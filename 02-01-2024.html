<p>Instead of connecting directly to a server that can<em> fulfill </em> a<strong>request</strong>  for a resource, such as a file or web page, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request, or provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to<small>distributed systems</small> .[2]  A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially masking the true<span>xorigin</span>  of the request to the resource server.</b> </p>
